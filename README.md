# Examples for Cells outside of Rails

# Plain Ruby

Shows using [cells in plain ruby environment](https://github.com/apotonick/cells-examples/blob/master/ruby/app.rb), without ActionPack and all the bad boys.

Also shows how to use cells caching with a simple hash (which could, of course, be a Redis store or whatever).

`````ruby
cd ruby
ruby app.rb
```
